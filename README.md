## Brief Overview

<img src="./screenshot.png" alt="project image" width="auto" height="550">

<p>This project is a school task that focuses on the use of pseudo classes in web development. For the project i have taken it upon myself to challenge my skills by incorporating additional elements such as Javascript and Sass.

As part of the project, i have  designed a portion calculator for a recipe with specific constraints for the end user. This calculator was created using Javascript.

Additionally, the project includes an image carousel, which required a significant amount of Javascript coding to get the slides working and the navigation updated.
<br>
The project consists of two main pages: "pseudo.html" and "adobo.html". The first page is a small overview of a few pseudo classes, while the second page showcases the use of almost all of them.</p>

# Lorem-recipes
A school task with emphesis on psuedo classes.

For this project i challenged myself with some addtion of javascript and use of sass.
- i experiemented with making a portions calculator for the recipe with a few restraints to the end user.
- there is also a image carousel that uses quite a bit javscript to get the slides working and the navigation updated.

The first page (Psuedo.html) is a small overview of a few psuedo classes and in the adobo.html we see almost all of them used.

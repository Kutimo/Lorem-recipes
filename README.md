# Lorem-recipes

A school task with emphasis on pseudo classes.

For this project i challenged myself with some addition of javascript and use of sass.

- i experimented with making a portions calculator for the recipe with a few restraints to the end user.
- there is also a image carousel that uses quite a bit javascript to get the slides working and the navigation updated.

The first page (pseudo.html) is a small overview of a few pseudo classes and in the adobo.html we see almost all of them used.
